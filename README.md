Here are the steps to run both your backend and frontend for your Galaxica project:

1. Run the Backend
    Open Terminal and navigate to your project folder:

    Install dependencies (if you haven’t yet):

    Make sure your data file exists
    The backend expects data.json. If it doesn’t exist, create it:

    Start the backend server:

    You should see:
    API server running at http://localhost:3001

2. Run the Frontend
    Open a new Terminal tab/window (keep backend running).

    Navigate to your project folder (if not already there):

    Install frontend dependencies (if you haven’t yet):

    Start the frontend dev server (assuming you use Vite or React Scripts):

    For Vite:
    For Create React App:
    Open your browser and go to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173 for Vite).

3. Test Everything
    Go to your frontend in the browser.
    The admin panel should load data from the backend.
    Try adding, editing, or deleting items.
    **If you get errors, let me know what they say!**

    5. Open your browser and go to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173 for Vite).
